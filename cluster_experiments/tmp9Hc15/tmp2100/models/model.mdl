	~	This factor is used to calculate the LPC without subsidies in order to \
		determine when the feedin tariff subsidy can be stopped. Instead of the \
		capacity factor, the average availability factor is used because the \
		capacity factor changes over time. Especially when RES-E is subsidized and \
		an oversupply of RES-E is in the market, the capacity factor decreases and \
		so the LPC increases. When a premium feedin tariff subsidy is used, this \
		would create a reinforcing feedback loop, more subsidies --> higher lpc \
		RES-E --> more subsidies needed to cover the market price gap.

		Amount of under construction, approved and applied is well presented. \
		However, the diversification of the total amount of capacity under \
		construction is not well presented. Therefore the current installed \
		capacity is duplicated proportional to this factor. What is remarkable is \
		that the UK and Ireland have very high ambitions regarding newly build \
		power generation capacity, mostly wind and gas plants.

		of renewable energy sources and other demographic and societal pressures, \
		an expected drastic increase in mineral resources is expected that is \
		in-use. This will cause prices to rise. Especially prices like rare earth \
		metals for permanent magnets in wind turbines and cadmium and tellurium in \
		solar cells. This causes the initial global resource price base growht for \
		these technologies to be somewhat higher than the other technologies. \
		However, history has proven that this price increase is limited by \
		increased recycling rates, better mining methods and mineral substitution. \
		All these uncertanties are aggregated into one factor, the intraday global \

Explanation: Available interconnection capacity is allocated according to the expected market price in a specific region. The lower the expected market price, the higher the expected exported amount of electricity. The (net) exported fraction of interconnection capacity plus the regional demand is the 'interconnected demand' per region. This interconnected demand is than allocated based on the variable costs per technology per region. The lower the variable costs, the higher the capacity fraction allocated
